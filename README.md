🔍 Project Overview
This Power BI report provides a comprehensive exploratory and analytical view of a diabetes dataset, focusing on medical indicators and demographic factors associated with diabetes risk.
The goal of this project is to transform raw clinical data into actionable insights that help understand patterns, correlations, and potential risk drivers for diabetes.
This dashboard is designed for:
•	Data analytics portfolios
•	Healthcare data exploration
•	Demonstrating Power BI storytelling & visualization skills
•	Learning medical data analysis concepts

🧩 Dataset Description
The dataset contains medical and demographic variables commonly used in diabetes research, including:
•	Glucose level
•	Insulin level
•	BMI (Body Mass Index)
•	Skin thickness
•	Blood pressure
•	Age
•	Pregnancy count
•	Diabetes outcome (target variable)
These variables are widely used in predictive modeling and health risk assessment.

2️⃣ Glucose & Insulin Analysis
This page focuses on two critical biomarkers:
•	Glucose distribution and its relation to diabetes
•	Insulin trends across patient groups
•	Correlation patterns between glucose, insulin, and outcomes
👉 Purpose: Identify how glucose and insulin levels influence diabetes likelihood.

3️⃣ BMI & Skin Thickness
Explores body composition metrics:
•	BMI distribution by outcome
•	Skin thickness patterns
•	Relationship between obesity indicators and diabetes risk
👉 Purpose: Highlight how body fat indicators correlate with diabetes.

5️⃣ Demographic & Age Insights
Focuses on population trends:
•	Age-group analysis
•	Diabetes prevalence by age
•	Distribution comparisons across demographics
👉 Purpose: Reveal how diabetes risk changes across age groups.
________________________________________
6️⃣ Pregnancy as a Factor
Investigates pregnancy-related impact:
•	Diabetes prevalence vs number of pregnancies
•	Risk patterns in higher pregnancy counts
•	Combined view with age and BMI
👉 Purpose: Study pregnancy as a contributing factor to diabetes risk.
